# tello-tricks
This is a class work assinment using tello if you couldent tell by the name. It is supposed to go to a location whitch I made random. Then it will randomly chose a number from 1 to 40. Whatever number it choses it sets that number to = a. Then its a lot of if statements each if statement will do something for the "dancmoves" be it moveing up, down left, right, flips or forwords or backwards.
